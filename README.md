# Blog

Blog is an application that allows users to create blog posts that are rendered to a list at creation. A like button tracks counts of likes from users.

Blog is a React and Redux based web application built with a Rails backend API. This repository is the front end, and the back end can be found at https://github.com/ageorge0160/new-blog-api.

## Getting Started

To run a local version of this application, you must clone and fork both this repository and "new-blog-api" (https://github.com/ageorge0160/new-blog-api).

Run ```npm install && npm start```. The back end needs to run in port 3000.
